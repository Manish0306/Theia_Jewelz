# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. Firebase SDK Version Mismatch
**Problem:** The HTML was loading Firebase v9 modular SDK, but the JavaScript code was using v8 syntax.
**Fix:** Updated HTML to use Firebase v8 SDK (8.10.1) which is compatible with the existing JavaScript code.

### 2. Duplicate Firebase Initialization
**Problem:** Firebase was being initialized twice - once in `firebase-config.js` and again in `app.js`.
**Fix:** Modified `app.js` to use the already initialized Firebase instance from `firebase-config.js`.

### 3. Missing App Initialization
**Problem:** The app class wasn't being instantiated when the page loaded.
**Fix:** Added proper app initialization script in the HTML.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated `index.html`:
- Changed Firebase SDK from v9 to v8
- Added app initialization script

### 2. Updated `app.js`:
- Modified `initializeFirebase()` to use existing Firebase instance
- Added debug logging to help troubleshoot login issues

### 3. Created `test-login.html`:
- Simple test page to verify login functionality works

## Test Credentials:
- **Username:** admin **Password:** admin123
- **Username:** user **Password:** user123

## How to Test:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Try logging in with the test credentials above
3. Check browser console (F12) for debug messages
4. If issues persist, try the `test-login.html` page first

## Troubleshooting:

If login still doesn't work:

1. **Check Browser Console:** Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab:** Look for failed requests to Firebase
3. **Verify Files:** Make sure all files are in the correct location
4. **Clear Cache:** Clear browser cache and reload the page

## Debug Information:

The app now logs detailed information to the console:
- Login attempts
- Firebase initialization status
- Credential validation results
- Any errors that occur

Check the browser console for these messages to help identify any remaining issues.
